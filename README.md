## Experimental WASM Enhance SSR

Compiling Enhance SSR to WASM would allow support of runtimes like Python and Ruby. 

This uses [Javy](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy) to compile enhance along with an embedded JavaScript runtime ([QuickJS](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs)).
The resulting WASM module requires a [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) (Web Assembly System Interface) compatible environment like [wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/introduction.html)
Wasmtime has supported packages for many [languages](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/lang.html) (including, python, ruby, rust, etc.).
There is also a browser shim to run in the [browser](https://github.com/bjorn3/browser_wasi_shim) although this not necessary because enhance can be bundled direcly in JS for the browser. 

## Try it without building
The compiled wasm is included in the repository. Give it a try. 
1. Install [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) to test the output.  
2. Run `cat input.json | wasmtime enhance.wasm` to see results. 

## Build and Run
1. Enhance css parser has some node api's that are not needed but must be removed to compile. 
Credit to @tbeseda for the following steps to remove them.
  - `@enhance/css-parser` has a reference to `'node:fs'` to support import maps. 
Comment out the conditional that dynamically requires `source-map-support.js` to in `node_modules/@enhance/css-parser/lib/stringify/index.js` to enable the build.

2. Enhance uses `nanoid` to generate instance id's. 
QuickJS does not fully support `crypto` yet, but these instance ids do not need to be secure.
Comment out references to nanoid in `node_modules/@enhance/ssr/index.js`.
Replace the `uuidFuction` in the options with the following function.

```javascript
function fakeUUID() {
  return 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function(c) {
    var r = Math.random() * 16 | 0, v = c == 'x' ? r : (r & 0x3 | 0x8);
    return v.toString(16);
  });
}
```
This is not for secure applications.

3. Download `javy` [built for your environment](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/releases) to `/javy` folder.

4. Build JS and compile WASM with `npm run build`

5. Install [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) to test the output.  

6. Run `cat input.json | wasmtime enhance.wasm` to see results.
